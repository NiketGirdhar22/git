# Version Control

- A version control system enables user to track changes to the source code, logs all the changes and makes it easier to recover older versions of the files if mistakes are made.
- It also makes the collaboration with team really easy and smooth

# Types of Version Control?

There are two major types of Version Control Systems:
- CVCS [Centralised Version Control System]
- DVCS [Distributed Version Control System]

| **Feature** | **CVCS** | **DVCS** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Repository** | Single central repository | Every user has a local repository |
| **Examples** | SVN, CVS, Perforce | Git, Mercurial, Bazaar |
| **Offline Access** | Limited [Requires connection to the central server] | Full access [works offline and can sync when you are back online] |
| **Commit Process** | Changes are committed directly to the central server | Changes are committed locally first, then pushed to the remote |
| **Branching and Merging** | Limited and more complex | Flexible, efficient, and easier to manage |
| **Performance** | Slower for large projects due to frequent server access | Faster for local operations, as all data is local |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Single point of failure [central server] | More robust [any local copy can act as a backup] |
| **Collaboration** | Requires users to commit directly to the central server | More flexible as users can work independently and sync later |
| **Complexity** | Simpler to use and manage | More complex due to local repositories and syncing |
| **Use Case** | Small to medium teams, smaller projects | Large teams, open-source projects, distributed development |

# What is git?

- Git is a free and open source software which uses Distributed Version Control System [DVCS in short] which means users present in any part of the world can easily access a copy of their projects on their computers.
- Any changes can be synced with a remote server and then accessed.
- Git isn't the only version control system but due to the DVCS aspect it is more widely used.

# What git offers

- **Remote access:** You can easily access your code anywhere and make changes remotely to your code and log the changes too.
- **Branching:** Use of feature branching to make multiple copeis of codes to make and test various changes to the code.

Note: There are the very basic features git offers, apart from these there are various others facilities and features offered by git.

# Terms associated with Git and Github

- **SSH:** Secure SHell protocol or SSH protocol is a method to remotely login from one computer to another.

- **Repository:** A Repository or a Repo is a storage location where all the files, directories, and version history related to a specific project are stored. It is typically managed using a version control system. The repository serves as the projectâ€™s root folder and contains everything needed for the project, including code, documentation, configuration files, and the history of changes made over time.

- **Fork:** Fork is used to copy a repo.

- **Pull request:** Pull request is used to request for review and approval of changes before they are finalized and added to the main source code.

- **Working Directory:** A Working Directory contains files and subdirectories on the system associated with the git repo.

- **Commit:** Commit is a snapshot or an instant in the source code in a specific point of time along with a description when changes are made in the repo.

- **Branch:** Branch is a separate line of development that allows users to work and test new features and also fixes without affecting the source code.

- **Merge:** Merging combines changes from one branch to another. It is typically used to merge a feature/fix branch into the main branch.

- **Clone Repo:** Cloning a repo creates a copy of a remote git repo into the local system.
